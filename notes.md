* Find new ideas  
  - take graduate courses and read textbooks to **get enough basic knowledge** for the research in the field  
  - find certain topics are interesting   
  - trying to **find recent survey papers**, pay attention to invited speeches  
  - **talk to researchers, and ask them their opinions** on the research areas, litsten to their paper presentations on **what sorts of problems** they work on, and how difficult they are   
  -  **find recent and high-impact research papers**, and **read them critically and creatively**  
  - **write a survey or review paper in the topic area** you are interested   

* How to read papers  
  - **read less, think more**  - think critically and creatively  
  - the purpose of reading published papers is to **make new discoveries that go beyong the existing works**    
  -   
  
  - reading textbooks is for **receiving existing knowledge**, while reading papers is for **outputtting new knowledge**   
  - when you read research papers, you are expected to **develop your own research ideas and questions to surpass their authors**.   
  -  

  - quickly **understand the problems, assumptions, main ideas, and the proposed solutions**  
    + like abstract, introduction, the new method or framework of ... and the experiments and the conclusions   
  - then spend more time to **analyze the paper critically, find new ideas, and conduct research** to surpass the previous papers  
    + critical  thinking - **what's wrong with the paper?  Are the assumptions reasonalbe?  is the problem ill-posed?  Does the solution have any technical flaws?   In what situations does it work well, or not so well?**   
    + creative thinking - **what else can be used to solve the same or broader problem?  how can I do it differently, and better?**  


* The key in reading published papers is to **know what has been done, and come up with novel ideas**.  

* focus on the big picture, not the minute details, and then "need-driven learning"  

* 生活是具體的
